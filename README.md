## RAYSHADE recompiled
### History
Rayshade is a pioneer standalone ray-tracing program written in C by Craig E. Kolb, between 1989 and 1991,
while he was an Msc student.
It was distributed as open-source, the simple license terms can be read at the beginning of each source file.
It was made to be portable across a variety of 32-bit platforms available at that time (mainly Unix-like).
I first ran it on Sun workstations, at my work place, in 1991.
### Why this repository ?
Even though this program is outdated compared with present days (2022) CG technology,
I am recording here 30 years of sparse attemps to keep it it alive until now. 
### This is a work in progress.
Commits will be added up to a 2022-PC-enabled version, stay tuned !
