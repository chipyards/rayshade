<H1>Notes on Rayshade - 1 - Introduction</H1>

Rayshade is a ray tracing program written by Craig Kolb and Rod Bogart.
The program reads a scene description file and then renders the scene.  The 
result is a 24 bit colour image which can then be displayed (or printed).
This document is not meant as a definitive reference to Rayshade (see Craig
Kolb's Rayshade User's Guide),  but it is meant to introduce the basics of 
Rayshade in simple terms (where possible!) and with many examples.<P>

<H2><a name="SceneDescription">Scene Description Files</H2>

The scene description files read by Rayshade need to follow a particular
syntax (grammar), deviation from this will often cause Rayshade to flag the
line with the incorrect information and then halt - without producing an 
image.  Most of this document is intended to explain the particular syntax 
required by Rayshade, but it should also give (through the examples) a guide
in how to approach creating scenes.<P>

The scenes rendered by Rayshade are described by lists of simple geometric
primitives, that are placed in three dimensional cartesian space.<P>

If Rayshade finds errors in a scene description, it identifies the kind of
error and the line number at which the error was detected.
<I>Sometimes Rayshade identifies the line after the line with the error.</I>
If, for example, a sphere has only three numbers following it (rather than
the four that are required), rayhsade will not 'flag' the line with the
sphere, it will flag the line where the next primitive (or whatever) starts,
because it is still looking for that fourth number....<P>
