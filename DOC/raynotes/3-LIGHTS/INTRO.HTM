<H1>Notes on Rayshade - 3 - Lighting and Atmospheric Effects</H1>

Rayshade provides a number of different light source types, from the simple 
"point" light to the much more computationally intensive "area" light.<p>

For each type of light you must specify the intensity, this is either a red-
green-blue triple indicating the colour of the light or a single value
(providing "white" light).<p>

If no light source is specified, a directional light with an intensity of
1.0 with a vector of (1, -1, 1) is used [Rayshade User's, Guide Chapter 4].<p>

Note that the light sources themselves are always invisible!<p>

The "background" light present in a scene, there can be only one ambient
light, if more than one are defined the last is used.<p>
