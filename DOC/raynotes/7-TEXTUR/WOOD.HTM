<pre>        texture wood</pre>

This texture produces a wood-like texture!  It also completely changes the
colour of the surface to which it is applied (the resulting surface is much
more "brown").<p>

In the example below six cream coloured boxes have wood texture applied to them.
The wood texture on all the boxes (except the one on the left) has been scaled.<p>

The wood texture works best (in my opinion) when the scale is extreme in one
direction - "along the grain" (like the bottom-right box in this example).<p>
