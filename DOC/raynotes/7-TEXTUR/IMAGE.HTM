This texture pastes a RLE image onto a surface.  Note that some
implementations of Rayshade use other image formats (TGA or MTV).
There are four main sources of images for you to use:<p>
<ul>
<li>images created using Rayshade;</li>
<li>scanned images (usually photographs);</li>
<li>images created using a "paint" program (and then converted into RLE images);</li>
<li>images "captured" from a computer screen.</li>
</ul>

The simplest way to use the image texture is to create a box from 0,0,0 to
1,1,1 with the image, then scale, rotate and finally translate the object.  The
box should be 0,0,0 to 1,1,1 because that's how big the image will be!  Once
the image is on the box, you can transform the box to produce the result you
desire.  Note that the image texture can also be transformed.<p>

For another example of this texture look at the example with the
<a href="../2-Primit/disc.htm">disc primitive</a>.<p>

NOTE the use of the "IMAGES/" prefix to the image file-names.
This tells rayshade to look in the "image library" which is located in the
/RLE directory.  <i>This is specific to our instalation at UNSW.</i>
A discussion of how this is achieved is contained in the section
"<a href="../8-tips/imagelib.htm">Creating an Images directory</a>"
in the next chapter.<p>
