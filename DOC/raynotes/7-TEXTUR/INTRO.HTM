<H1>Notes on Rayshade - 7 - Textures</h1>

Textures are applied to primitives and/or objects to alter the appearance
of the object.  There are a number of different textures available with
Rayshade, though most of them are based on a semi-random function called
"noise".  The general format for using a texture is:<p>

<pre><i>        object</i> texture <i>name [texture-arguments]</i></pre>

for example (from <a href="../5-object/list.htm#black-piece">chess.ray</a>):<p>

<pre>        object black chess_piece texture gloss 1</pre>

or (simply):<p>

<pre>        box 0 0 0  10 10 1  texture wood

</pre>

Note that more than one texture may be applied to an object and that
textures may be transformed
(see <a href="../2-primit/plane.htm#waves">waves.ray</a>).<p>
