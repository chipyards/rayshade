<pre>
        [name  <i>objname</i>]  grid  <i>xvox yvox zvox

The second type of aggregate object is the 'grid' object.  This object type can
speed up processing of complex objects that form part of some (larger) scene.
The object's extent is divided up into the specified number of voxels, a list is
made specifying which parts of the object are in each voxel, this reduces the
time taken in intersection testing.<p>

There is no example for Grid (yet).<p>
