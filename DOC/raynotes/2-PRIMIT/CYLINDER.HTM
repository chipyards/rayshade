Create a cylinder of given radius from (bx by bz) to (tx ty tz).  Note that
cylinders are not solid:  in order to do <a href="../5-object/csg.htm">CSG</a>
operations using cylinders, you must first close off the end of the cylinder
(the disc primitive is ideal for this).<p>

Often the best way to deal with cylinders (and cones) that need to be closed,
is to create an object which is a cylinder (centred at 0 0 0) with a disc at each
end, then to transform the object to the appropriate position and use it.<p>

In this example a closed cylinder object is created, then used to create a tube
10 long with a radius of 4 and a thickness of 0.05.  This "tube" is then
intersected with a box (that has been rotated at 45 degrees) to produce a curving
"shell", like a curving roof.<p>
