</pre>

The specified heightfield file is read.  The heighfield file contains height-
values which are used to create a "landscape" within a 1 x 1 x 1 cube.  This 
is normally transformed into a more appropriate size, to create a desired 
effect.  The best way to use this primitive is to write (or use) a program to 
translate ASCII (plain text) height files into heightfield files, or, better
still, write (or use) a program to create heightfield "landscapes".<p>

There is no example for heightfield (yet).  Refer to Appendix C of the
Rayshade User's Guide.<p>
