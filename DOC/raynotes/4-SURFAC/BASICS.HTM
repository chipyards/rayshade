<h2><a name="ambient">ambient</h2>
<pre>        ambient <i>red green blue</i>
</pre>
The colour "red green blue" is 3 numbers (each ranging from 0 - 1), that
together create a colour.<p>

The ambient is used to model the surface's background colour, that is, the
object's colour if it wasn't receiving light.  The
<a href="../3-Lights/intro.htm">ambient light</a> source in a
scene may be defined, by default it is 1 1 1.<p>

<i>Every part of every object will receive the ambient defined for it's surface.</I><p>

See example below.<p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="diffuse">diffuse</h2>
<pre>        diffuse <i>red green blue</i>
</pre>
The diffuse light is the light received on a surface from a light source,
including light reflected from other surfaces.<p>

See example below.<p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="specular">specular</h2>
<pre>        specular <i>red green blue</i>
</pre>
Specular light refers to surface "highlights".<p>

See example below.<p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="specpow">Specular Highlights</h2>
<pre>        specpow <i>exponent</i>
</pre>

The specpow controls the size of specular highlights:  the larger the number
the smaller the highlight.<p>

See example below.<p>

<hr>
The four keywords above define the basics of a surface's colour properties.
The actual colour
of a particular portion of a surface depends upon what kind of light the
surface is receiving.  If the area is not receiving light from any light source
then it only receives ambient light;  if it is receiving light from one
(or more) light sources then it will have a diffuse (as well as an ambient)
component - the two components will be added together to give the colour of
the area;  if the area is also reflecting light back towards the eye point
then a specular component will be added to the other two parts to give the
final colour of the area.<p>

In the example below, very different colours are used for ambient, diffuse and
specular:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>the areas in shadow only receive ambient light (and so are red);
    <li>the areas receiving light are yellow:  ambient (red) + diffuse (green); and
    <li>the areas that reflect back towards the eye point are white:
        ambient (red) + diffuse (green) + specular (blue).
    </ul>

This example encapsulates defining surfaces!<p>
