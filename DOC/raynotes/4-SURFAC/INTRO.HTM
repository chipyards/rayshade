<H1>Defining Surfaces - Introduction</h1>

Rayshade defines the characteristics of a surface through a number of
keywords (see below), there are also a number of ways in which surface
characteristics can be applied to an object.  The simplest way is to define a
named surface and then use that name when defining the primitive;
alternatively, the surface definition may be placed with the primitive, after
the primitive's keyword and before its parameters;  the last way is to apply a
surface definition to an instance of an object.<p>

<pre>        surface <i>surface-name surface-definition</i>
</pre>

The surface keyword is used to associate a name with a surface definition
(see "PeachPuff" in the example below).  Any object that does not have a
surface definition associated with it is assigned Rayshade's default surface (a
white/grey).<p>

The example below, demonstrates each of the ways to apply surfaces to objects.
    <ul><li>In the first object (box) a defined surface (PeachPuff) is used;
            this is (in my opinion) the simplest and most straight-forward way
            to apply a surface to an object.
        <li>The second object (torus) has its surface definition with
            the object definition.
        <li>The next object (cone) has no surface - it uses Rayshade's
            default surface (grey).
        <li>The last object is a blue bowl:  the bowl is created without any
            surface definitions, then when the bowl is included in the scene a
            surface (blue) is applied to it;  this technique allows different
            surfaces to be applied to the same object!
    </ul>
