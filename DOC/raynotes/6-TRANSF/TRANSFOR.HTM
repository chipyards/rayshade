</pre>

Transform is the most general transformation provided with Rayshade.  The
nine numbers (x1 - z3) describe a 3 by 3 transformation matrix, which can
provide scaling and shear.  An explanation of matrix manipulation is beyond
the scope of these notes (refer to a high school or first year university
mathematics textbook);  but, I will explain how this operator can be used!<p>

The transformation below has absolutely no effect!  The three "1"s on the
diagonal here provide scaling - though in this case a scale of 1 (which
causes no change).  Whenever you use transform, you must have non-zero
values for all three numbers on the diagonal.<p>

<pre>        box 10 10 10  20 20 20
        transform
            1  0  0
            0  1  0
            0  0  1
</pre>

The figure 6-7 (below) shows the effect of changing one number  (in the matrix
above) to 2;  the position in the diagram corresponds to the matrix position
changed.  <i>Note that the axes change from X-Y to X-Z or Y-Z in some cases.</i>
The view shown has been chosen to display the result with the least
ambiguity.<p>

If you study the diagram carefully, you will be able to discern a number
of patterns.  Firstly, changing values in the first column changes the X
values, changing the second the Y and changing the third changes the Z.
Secondly, changing the main diagonal has a scaling effect;  while the
other positions provide shear.<p>

In other words the view in the middle-top panel represents:<p>
<pre>       box 10 10 10  20 20 20
           transform
               1    2    0
               0    1    0
               0    0    1
</pre>

It should be noted that this diagram shows, in each case, the results of
changing one value (from 0 or 1 to 2).  Much more complex results can be
obtained by changing more than one value!  For example to rotate by "Q"
degrees (in X-Y) the matrix would be:<p>
<pre>        cosQ  sinQ  0    -sinQ  cosQ  0    0  0  1</pre>
though this is achieved much easier using rotate (you would not need to
calculate the sin's and cos's).<p>

An example may make this clear:  to create a staircase balustrade, I want to
shear a (normal) balustrade by the height that the stair rises over the length
of the balustrade object.  The stair has a going (tread) of 275 and a riser
(step height) of 165, the balustrade object will be 1100 long (over 4 goings)
and in that distance should shear 660 (4 risers).<p>

Looking at figure 6-7 (above), the only view showing a Z shear in the X-Z plane
is in the top-right - so the basic form of the transformation will be:<p>

<pre>        object balustrade
            transform
                1    0    k
                0    1    0
                0    0    1
</pre>

where "k" is some number (to be determined) that will produce the correct
shear result!  The way to calculate "k" is quite simple:  take the coordinate at
the top right of the object (1100 0 1000) and concatenate it with the matrix:<p>

<pre>        1100    0    1000          1    0    k
                                   0    1    0
                                   0    0    1
</pre>

This produces a Z value of:<p>
<pre>                                 k x 1100 + 1000</pre>
which we want to equal:<p>
<pre>                                 660 + 1000</pre>
therefore:<p>
<pre>                                 660 = k x 1100</pre>
therefore "k" equals:<p>
<pre>                                 660/1100 = 0.6</pre>

Note in the example below, the use of the optional X Y Z translation
to produce the second segment of the balustrade.<p>
