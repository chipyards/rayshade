<h1>Introduction</h1>
Rayshade provides three straight-forward transformations and one
general purpose (but not straight-forward) transformation.
Rotate and scale can sometimes cause problems for the 'beginner'
because they don't simply spin or enlarge an object they transform
the object relative to the origin (this is explained further below).<p>

<pre>        rotate <i>xdir ydir zdir angle</i>
</pre>

There are two things two remember with rotate, the first is that (like
scale) it is inherrently a multiplication action and the second is that
the rotation angle is anti-clockwise (in degrees).<p>

The vector (xdir ydir zdir) to (0 0 0) provides the axis about which the
"object" is rotated.  To understand how this operates, image yourself at the
position (xdir ydir zdir) looking towards (0 0 0), the object will be rotate the
specified number of (anti-clockwise) degrees perpendicular to this view.<p>

While it is possible for (xdir, ydir, zdir) to be any coordinate, it is usually
advisable initially to rotate about one of the three axes.<p>

A simple example should make this clear:<p>

<pre>        box  10 10 10  20 20 20  rotate  0 0 1  45</pre>

The result of this rotation is that the box, which was centred at (15 15 15)
and had aligned with the axes is now centred at (0 21.2 15) with sides at 45
degrees to the axes (see figure 6-1 above).<p>

As with scale, it is often best to translate an object to the origin, before
rotating it.<p>

This example is a column with curves cutting into the vertical.<p>
