<h2><a name="images">Creating an Images directory</h2>

The following section describes how I have implemented a Rayshade
Image Library (for for by the students here at UNSW).<p>

When creating models of buildings, it is often very useful to include
images inside (and outside) the spaces being modelled.  The images could
be used as textures (for example: wallpaper or tiles) or as paintings/pictures
or even as outside "scenes"....<p>

The script file I use to run Rayshade includes the following:

<pre>        rayshade FILE.ray -P '-Y/staff/raylib -DIMAGES=/staff/RLE' -O FILE.rle 2> FILE.msg

where   FILE            is the name of the rayshade description file; and
        /staff/RLE      is the location of the image "library" files.
</pre>

The -P instructs Rayshade to pass the text in quotes as parameters to cpp.
The -D is like using #define, in the example above it defines "IMAGES" as
being the directory "/staff/RLE".  This directory includes images that can
be accessed by all the people using Rayshade.<p>

For example:

<pre>        name mountain
            box 0 0 0   1 1 1   texture image IMAGES/mountain.rle

        object mountain
            scale   3000 2000 1       /* scale the image to it's proper size */
            rotate   1 0 0   90       /* stand it up                         */
            rotate   0 0 1   90       /* align the picture along the Y axis  */
            translate 8000 3500 1700  /* put it in place                     */
</pre>
