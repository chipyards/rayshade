<H1>Notes on Rayshade - 8 - Tips and Tricks</h1>

This section contains a number of "tips and tricks"
relating to creating Rayshade scenes and/or using Rayshade.
It needs to be expanded!<p>

<hr><h2><a name="cpp">Using the C language Preprocessor</h2>

Before Rayshade parses a file, it passes the file to
a program called "cpp" (the C language preprocessor,
which is invoked as the first pass of C compilations
on most unix computers).<p>

Cpp processes a number of <i>directives</i> including:<p>
<ul>
    <li><code>#define        </code> see <a href="define.htm">"Using #define"</a>.
    <li><code>#undef         </code> no example yet.
    <li><code>#include       </code> see <a href="raylib.htm">"Creating an Object Library"</a>.
    <li><code>#if            </code> no example yet.
    <li><code>#ifdef         </code> no example yet.
</ul>
There are also a number of parameters that can be included when
the program is called, including:
<pre><ul><li>-Y<i>directory</i>    add 'directory' to include list (#include &lt;filename&gt;).<br>
              see <a href="raylib.htm">"Creating an Object Library"</a>.
         <li>-D<i>name=def</i>     similar to #define<br>
              see <a href="imagelib.htm">"Creating an Image Library"</a>.
         <li>-I<i>directory</i>    add 'directory' to include list (#include "filename").
</ul></pre>

For details on "cpp" refer to the documentation available at
your site.  Various versions of the program may have particular
syntax requirements...<p>
